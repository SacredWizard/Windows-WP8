#SoundMaster
SoundMaster is a sound based app that contains various pre recorded sound snippets under categories. New sounds can be recorded and added to a different category.

#Install
* Visual Studio 2012 Express or any higher updated version has to be installed.
* Windows 8 Phone SDK must be installed.
* Download the [zip](https://github.com/SacredWizard/Windows-WP8/archive/SoundMaster.zip) folder
* Unzip it
* Open **SoundMaster.sln** (Now visual studio opens up)
* Run the App using the emulator or using externally connected phone (The Phone has to be registered to run in debug mode)

#Note
There is no option to delete the sound, once the sound is recorded it stays in the app so use it carefully.
